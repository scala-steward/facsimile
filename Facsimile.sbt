/** Published project settings.
 *
 *  Published projects must define the artifacts to be published, and take care of publishing them to the _Sonatype
 *  Central_ repository. Consequently, there is a lot of _Maven_/_SBT_/_Ivy_ configuration information here.
 *
 *  Note that publishing artifacts to the _Sonatype Central_ repository ensures that those same artifacts are available
 *  through the _Maven Central Repository_.
 *
 *  NOTES:
 *  1. Test artifacts should NOT be published. This is disabled by the line `Test / publishArtifact := false` below.
 *  2. Third-party artifacts referenced by _Facsimile_ must be available from the _Maven Central Repository_.
 *  3. _Maven_ metadata that is not defined by _SBT_ properties must be defined in the `pomExtra` setting as XML.
 *  4. Artifacts must be signed via _GNU Privacy Guard_ (_GPG_) for verification and authenticity purposes. This is also
 *     essential for artifacts to be published to the _Sonatype Central_ repository; in this case, the software must be
 *     signed using the key for _authentication@facsim.org_. (If your version of _Facsimile_ is signed by a different
 *     key, then you do not have the official version.)
 *
 *  The _sbt-gpg_ plugin uses _GPG_ to sign artifacts, and this must be installed on the current machine. The key ID
 *  must be specified in a file configured by the Release Manager, typically "~/.sbt/2/Credentials.sbt". Finally, the
 *  key (including the private key) must be registered in _GPG_ on the local machine.
 *
 *  For best results, all releases and code release signing should be undertaken on a _Linux_ or _macOS_ system.
 *
 *  __WARNING: THE GPG SECRET KEY AND THE CREDENTIALS FILE MUST NEVER BE MADE PUBLIC AND SHOULD NEVER BE COMMITTED AS
 *  PART OF ANY SOURCES__.
 *
 *  We publish to the snapshots repository if this is a snapshot, or to the releases staging repository if this is an
 *  official release.
